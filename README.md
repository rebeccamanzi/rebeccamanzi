[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=js,ts,html,css,angular,react,azure,cs,dotnet,nodejs,git,github,)](https://skillicons.dev)

I am a Fullstack Developer currently working and focused on .NET and Angular. I also appreciate and have worked with Javascript, Typescript, React, and Node. I have experience with databases and cloud, and it's something I want to go deeper into.

I'm a self-taught person who changed careers in 2020 (from business to technology). I have a degree in Business Administration and am doing a Postgraduate Degree in Software and Solutions Architecture. What I love about the development area is being able to use my creativity and logical reasoning to solve problems.
