## Hello World! 👋🏻👋🏻

I am a Fullstack Developer currently working and focused on .NET and Angular. I also appreciate and have worked with Javascript, Typescript, React, Node, SQL and Cloud (AWS/Azure).

I'm a self-taught person who changed careers in 2020 (from business to technology). I have a degree in Business Administration and am doing a Postgraduate Degree in Software and Solutions Architecture. What I love about the development area is being able to use my creativity and logical reasoning to solve problems.

🏝️ Live in Recife, Brazil <br>
🎧 Love almost all types of music, especially Lofi, R&B, MPB and Techno <br>
🌱 Everyday is a learning opportunity <br>
🏃🏻‍♀️ Trying to have a fitness life <br>
🎞️ In my free time I love watching series and films, and reading books <br>
🎮 Eventually I play a little LoL and do puzzles <br>
